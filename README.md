Our project aims to develop clinical risk prediction models using the LGBM machine learning model on  Psoriasis (PsD) datasets. We will assess the importance of various clinical factors and evaluate the model's performance, with a focus on demonstrating that the potential biological targets PRSS8 and CDSN have significant predictive value for PsD.
