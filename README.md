Objective 
The aim of this study is to identify new predictive biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets for psoriatic diseases (PsD). 
Methods 
In the MR-based analytical framework, we utilized data from nine large proteogenomics studies to explore causal associations between genetically predicted plasma proteins and PsD. We further validated their expression at the transcript level. Additionally, protein biomarkers were evaluated in a large cohort, and proof-of-concept was provided to investigate whether these protein biomarkers could potentially improve the prediction model for PsD. Finally, we used siRNA to silence gene expression and assessed the therapeutic role of the most promising proteins.
Results 
We screened 4,199 proteins and identified 23 candidate proteins significantly associated with incident PsD. At the transcript level, the mRNA expression of eight candidate proteins showed significant differences between psoriatic and non-psoriatic samples, as well as between lesional and non-lesional skin in PsD patients. In a large cohort over 12 years of follow-up, plasma levels of PRSS8 and CDSN were associated with a 39% and 23% higher risk of incident PsD per SD increase, respectively. Incorporating PRSS8 and CDSN significantly improved the model based on clinical predictors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89 compared to 0.70. Silencing PRSS8 and CDSN resulted in a significant reduction of psoriasis-like lesions and inflammatory markers in vivo.
Conclusions  
Our study has uncovered numerous plasma proteins associated with PsD. Among these candidate proteins, PRSS8 and CDSN stand out as both predictive biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets.
